#' @title Return details about form's fields
#'
#' @description The Fields API describes a hierarchy of your data. At the heart of this API is the
#' listing of FieldId values. Each FieldId corresponds to a value in the Entries API.
#'
#' @return Title - The title is the friendly name you gave the field when creating your form. For
#' example, if you were building a table with the API, the Title would be a column header.
#' @return Type - The Type represents a Wufoo field type. A listing of the these types can be found
#' in the Field Type section of this documentation.
#' @return ID - This is the unique reference ID for your field. There will be one corresponding ID
#' for each Entry in return value of the the Entries API.
#' @return IsRequired - This value can be one or zero, representing whether or not the field has
#' been marked required in the Form Builder.
#' @return OtherField - This value is true or false and is only set if the field has choices. Only
#' Multiple-Choice fields have the option of an Other field. When a Multiple-Choice field is marked
#' as HasOtherField, the last choice is the Other field.
#'
#' @note For developers: This function returns 2 data frames. One containing only default fields, another one containing
#' subfields as described \url{http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/The-Fields-API#Fancypants}.
#' "These include name, shortname, checkbox, address, and likert."
