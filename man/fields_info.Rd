\value{
Title - The title is the friendly name you gave the field when creating your form. For
example, if you were building a table with the API, the Title would be a column header.

Type - The Type represents a Wufoo field type. A listing of the these types can be found
in the Field Type section of this documentation.

ID - This is the unique reference ID for your field. There will be one corresponding ID
for each Entry in return value of the the Entries API.

IsRequired - This value can be one or zero, representing whether or not the field has
been marked required in the Form Builder.

OtherField - This value is true or false and is only set if the field has choices. Only
Multiple-Choice fields have the option of an Other field. When a Multiple-Choice field is marked
as HasOtherField, the last choice is the Other field.
}
\description{
The Fields API describes a hierarchy of your data. At the heart of this API is the
listing of FieldId values. Each FieldId corresponds to a value in the Entries API.

\note{
For developers: This function returns 2 data frames. One containing only default fields, another one containing
subfields as described \url{http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/The-Fields-API#Fancypants}.
"These include name, shortname, checkbox, address, and likert."
